- 👋 Hi, I’m @fastpays4u
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an automated cashier system for my company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding and development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating an automated cashier system for the Sweepstakes Entertainment Gaming Industry. I am willing to trade equity in my company for help creating an automated cashier. I have more than 100,000 companies interested in a yearly license for $10,000-$20,000 each. Would prefer to work with someone in Texas or at least in the United States.
